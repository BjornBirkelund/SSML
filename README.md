## SoundSensing Machine Learning

In this project I learned the various steps of the machine learning process alongside my twin brother Giovanni Birkelund for SoundSensing.  This includes: Planning for data gathering, gathering and recording data, classification, preprocessing/cleanup, and helping with applying a machine learning model - the code is classified company data so I will not be showing it here.
